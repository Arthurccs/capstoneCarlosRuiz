  <h2>Reading</h2>
  <p>I have a deep interest in reading, particularly in fields such as leadership, history, and psychology. 
    I enjoy immersing myself in books that allow me to absorb the wisdom and strategies of great leaders throughout 
    history, as well as gain insight into the past and the human mind for a unique perspective on the world. 
    Novels also hold a special place in my heart as they transport me to different worlds, let me live different lives, 
    and experience a range of emotions.</p>

  <h3>Video Games</h3>
  <p>When it comes to video games, I am a fan of titles like FIFA, Call of Duty, and the Final Fantasy series. 
    I find the mix of strategy, action, and storytelling in these games incredibly engaging.</p>

  <h3>Traveling</h3>
  <p>Furthermore, I love to travel and explore new destinations, preferably on road trips. 
    There is something liberating about hitting the open road and not knowing what new experiences each turn will bring. 
    Exploring new destinations, each with its own unique culture, history, and scenery, 
    allows me to break free from routine and experience the vast diversity of the world.</p>
